Q4
# Given probability of a single attempt resulting in a wrong number
p_single_attempt = 1/200

# Probability that none of the five attempts result in a wrong number
p_none_wrong = (1 - p_single_attempt)**5

# Probability that at least one of the five attempts reaches the wrong number
p_at_least_one_wrong = 1 - p_none_wrong

print(f"The probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number is approximately {p_at_least_one_wrong:.6f}")

Q5 1
# Given probability distribution
outcomes = [-2000, -1000, 0, 1000, 2000, 3000]
probabilities = [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1]

# Calculate the expected value
expected_value = sum(x * p for x, p in zip(outcomes, probabilities))

print(f"The most likely monetary outcome of the business venture is ${expected_value:.0f}")

Q5 2

# Given probability distribution

Q5 3

# Given probability distribution
outcomes = [-2000, -1000, 0, 1000, 2000, 3000]
probabilities = [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1]

# Calculate the expected value (long-term average earning)
expected_value = sum(x * p for x, p in zip(outcomes, probabilities))

print(f"The long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind is ${expected_value:.0f}")

Q5 4
import math

# Calculate the standard deviation
std_deviation = math.sqrt(sum((x - expected_value)**2 * p for x, p in zip(outcomes, probabilities)))

print(f"The standard deviation, a measure of risk, for theThe standard deviation, a measure of risk, for the venture of this kind is approximately $1470 venture of this kind is approximately ${std_deviation:.0f}")
